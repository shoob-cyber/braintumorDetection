A polished, easy-to-run Flask app that classifies brain MRI scans into four categories using a pretrained TensorFlow model (VGG16 transfer learning). This repository is intended for research and educational purposes only — it is not a medical device.

---

## ✨ Highlights

- Clean single-file Flask backend with a lightweight frontend
- Pretrained model included for quick testing (`model/brain_tumor_model.h5`)
- Simple drag-and-drop image upload and instant prediction
- Educational info and suggested specialist for each predicted class

---

## Demo

Open the app locally and upload an MRI image to see predictions with confidence scores and short educational notes.

---

## Quick Start

1. Create and activate a virtual environment

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

macOS / Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the app

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser.

---

## Project Structure

- `app.py` — Flask application serving the web UI and `/predict` endpoint
- `model/brain_tumor_model.h5` — pretrained Keras model (4-class)
- `templates/index.html` — frontend HTML
- `static/` — CSS and client-side JavaScript
- `training/Brain_Tumor_Training.ipynb` — training notebook demonstrating VGG16 transfer learning

---

## How It Works (high level)

1. User uploads an MRI image from the browser
2. Frontend sends the image to `POST /predict` as form data
3. Backend preprocesses the image (resize, scale) and runs `model.predict`
4. Backend responds with predicted label, confidence, and educational notes

---

## Model & Training Notes

- The training notebook uses VGG16 (transfer learning) with an input size of 150×150 and a custom dense head.
- Make sure inference preprocessing matches the preprocessing used during training (resize, color ordering, and scaling).
- If you retrain, save your model to `model/brain_tumor_model.h5` to keep the web app working.

---

## Dependencies (suggested)

The repository's `requirements.txt` lists the main packages. Note: `Flask` and `Pillow` are required by the app — add them if missing.

---

## Security & Production Notes

- `app.run(debug=True)` is for development only. Use a WSGI server (Gunicorn/Waitress) and set `debug=False` in production.
- Consider adding input validation, file-size limits, and antivirus scanning for uploaded files.

---

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome — open an issue or a pull request. Suggested improvements:

- Add Grad-CAM visualizations to explain predictions
- Provide a REST API endpoint with authentication
- Add tests and CI

If you'd like, I can also:

- update `requirements.txt` to include `Flask` and `Pillow` and pin versions
- add a small `run.ps1` helper for Windows
- adjust `app.py` preprocessing to match training if you want me to check it

Enjoy exploring the model — and remember this is educational only!
