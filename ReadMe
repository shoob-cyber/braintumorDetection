🧠 Brain Tumor Detector & Classifier

A Deep Learning–powered web application for classifying brain tumors from MRI scans.

⚠️ Medical Disclaimer

This project is intended strictly for educational and research purposes.
It is NOT a medical diagnostic tool and must not be used for clinical or professional healthcare decisions.
Always consult a qualified medical practitioner for real medical concerns.

🌟 Overview

The Brain Tumor Detector & Classifier is a web-based tool that uses a fine-tuned deep learning model (VGG16-based CNN) to classify MRI brain scans into the following categories:

Meningioma Tumor

Glioma Tumor

Pituitary Tumor

No Tumor Detected

The web interface is built using Flask, enabling users to upload MRI images and receive predictions with confidence scores.

✨ Features
✔ Image Classification

Upload an MRI image and get a tumor category prediction.

✔ Multi-Class Prediction

Classifies images into 4 classes:

Meningioma

Glioma

Pituitary

Healthy (No Tumor)

✔ Confidence Score

Displays the model’s confidence as a percentage.

✔ Medical Summary

Provides short educational info and suggests which medical specialist to consult (e.g., neurologist, neurosurgeon).

✔ Simple Web Interface

Clean UI built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

🚀 Getting Started
✅ Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8+

pip

Git

(Optional) NVIDIA GPU + CUDA/cuDNN for faster training

🔧 Installation Guide
1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Thanatos624/BrainTumorDetection
cd BrainTumorDetection

2️⃣ Create and activate a virtual environment
Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

macOS / Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

3️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

4️⃣ Download the dataset

Dataset: Brain Tumor MRI Dataset (Kaggle)
Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets

After downloading:

Unzip the dataset.

Copy the Training folder into the project:

project_root/training/dataset/


The folder structure should look like:

training/dataset/
 ├── glioma_tumor/
 ├── meningioma_tumor/
 ├── no_tumor/
 └── pituitary_tumor/

🧑‍💻 Training the Model (Optional)

A pre-trained model is already included at:

model/brain_tumor_model.h5


If you want to retrain:

python training/Brain_Tumor_Training.py


This will:

Load & preprocess the dataset

Fine-tune VGG16

Save the trained model in model/

▶️ Running the Web Application

From the project root:

python app.py


If Flask starts successfully, you'll see something like:

Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/


Open your browser and navigate to:

👉 http://127.0.0.1:5000/
🧪 How to Use

Click "Choose an MRI Image" on the home page.

Select any .jpg, .png, or .jpeg MRI brain image.

Click "Classify Tumor".

🧠 Model Information

The classifier is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using TensorFlow/Keras.
To improve accuracy, it uses Transfer Learning from the VGG16 model (pre-trained on ImageNet):

🔍 Steps used:

Freeze early VGG16 layers

Add custom classification layers

Train on MRI tumor dataset

Achieved high accuracy after fine-tuning

📌 Future Enhancements

Add Grad-CAM visual explanations

Add full patient report generation (PDF export)

Introduce real-time webcam classification

Expand dataset with more MRI modalities
