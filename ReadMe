## 📋 Overview

**Brain Tumor Detector & Classifier** is a web-based deep learning application that classifies brain MRI scans into four categories using a pre-trained convolutional neural network.

**Tumor Classes:**
- Glioma Tumor
- Meningioma Tumor
- Pituitary Tumor
- No Tumor (Healthy Scan)

**Tech Used:** Python, Flask, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV  
**Model:** VGG16 (Transfer Learning)  
**Purpose:** Educational & Research Use Only

## 🔄 How It Works

1. User uploads a brain MRI image
2. Image is resized and normalized
3. Processed image is passed to the model
4. Model outputs probabilities for each class
5. Highest probability class is selected
6. Result and confidence score are shown on UI
