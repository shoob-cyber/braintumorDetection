Brain Tumor Detector & Classifier 🧠
A web-based application built with Python and TensorFlow to classify brain tumors from MRI scans. This tool can identify three common types of brain tumors (Meningioma, Glioma, Pituitary) or determine if no tumor is present.

🛑 Medical Disclaimer: This project is for educational and demonstrational purposes ONLY. It is not a medical tool and should not be used for professional diagnosis. Always consult a qualified medical professional for any health concerns.

✨ Features
Image-Based Classification: Upload an MRI scan image to get a prediction.

Multi-Class Classification: Identifies four distinct categories:

Meningioma Tumor

Glioma Tumor

Pituitary Tumor

No Tumor

Confidence Score: Displays the model's confidence level for the prediction.

General Information: Provides a brief, educational description and suggests the type of specialist to consult for the predicted tumor type.

Web-Based Interface: Simple and intuitive front end built with Flask.

💻 Technology Stack
Backend: Python, Flask

Machine Learning: TensorFlow, Keras

Image Processing: OpenCV, Pillow

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Development: Jupyter Notebook

🚀 Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

pip (Python package installer)

Git

(Optional but Recommended) An NVIDIA GPU with CUDA and cuDNN installed for faster training.

Installation Steps
Clone the repository
Open your terminal and clone this project.

git clone [https://github.com/Thanatos624/BrainTumorDetection](https://github.com/Thanatos624/BrainTumorDetection)
cd brain-tumor-detector

Create a virtual environment
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated.

# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Install dependencies
Install all the required Python packages using the requirements.txt file.

pip install -r requirements.txt

Download the dataset
The model was trained on the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset from Kaggle.

Download the dataset.

Unzip the file.

Copy the Training folder into the training/ directory of the project and rename it to dataset.

Train the model (Optional)
The trained model (brain_tumor_model.h5) is included in the model/ directory. 
However, if you want to retrain it yourself, run the training script:

python training/Brain_Tumor_Training.py

🛠️ Usage
Run the Flask application
From the root directory of the project, run the following command:

python app.py

Open the application in your browser
Navigate to the following address:
http://127.0.0.1:5000

Upload and Classify

Click "Choose an MRI Image" to select a file from your computer.

Click the "Classify Tumor" button to get the prediction.

The result, confidence score, and additional information will be displayed on the page.

🧠 Model Information
The classification model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using the Keras API within TensorFlow. 
To achieve high accuracy, it leverages Transfer Learning with the VGG16 architecture, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset.
The model was then fine-tuned on the specific task of classifying brain tumor MRI scans.
